				</p><p>In the summer of 2016, I decided to try to make a terrain generator. (Or rather, to go back to experimenting with terrain generation, as I had tried in the past.) In order to do this, I created my own noise generation algorithm. I could have just used something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin Noise</a> but a common theme with my projects is &quot;Re-inventing the wheel is okay if you learn something in the process.&quot; Also, if I make my own algorithms, I'll be sure to understand them. (Usually)</p><p>Anyway, I started making a noise generation algorithm. My base idea was simple: If we assign random values to points on a grid, and then interpolate, we'll end up with smooth noise. I picked a seedable random number generator off the Internet (I probably made a bad choice â€“ more on this below) and started prototyping my idea in Javascript. Pretty soon I had something that generated stuff like this: </p><p><img src="KerwizzyBlogData/QuickNoise-Demo1.jpg"><br><em>An early version of my noise generation algorithm. (Note that the red crosses were added for this post)</em><br></p><p>Here's the detailed algorithm by which this image was generated:</p><ol><li>Each pixel in the image was iterated over. For each pixel:<ol><li>The program calculated the location of the square that contained the point. (Corners of squares have been marked by red crosses. The size of a square is equal to the frequency of the noise. In this case: 40 pixels)</li><li>The program calculated the location of the pixel relative to the square</li><li>The pseudo-random number generator was seeded with the coordinates of each corner of the square. After being seeded, the random values at each corner were calculated.</li><li>Based on the pixel's location in the square, different values at each corner were blended together using simple ease-in, ease-out interpolation. The resulting value was returned.</li></ol></li><li>The value was drawn on the Javascript canvas.</li></ol><p>There are some obvious problems with the above image. Most noticeable is the blockiness of the image. Also noticeable are the 3 white hotspots in the image. (I'm not actually sure what caused them. They seem to be some sort of clamping/looping problem...) I took care of the blockiness problem by combining two sets of noise to get the final result: the first set having the corners of the squares aligned as above, the second set having the corners offset by half the frequency. This made for smooth looking noise.</p><p>Because my noise algorithm was a fairly slow, and locked up my web browser while I was rendering images like the above, I decided to repurpose my <a href="HTML5%20Fractal%20Renderer.html">Fractal Rendering Program</a> to display noise generated by my algorithm. The arguments to functions for iterating fractals are basically identical to the arguments to my noise generation function. They both take in x and y coordinates, calculate values for all points independently, and return floating point values.</p><p>After getting my noise generator working, I wrote a first a 2.5D (Colors with a 2D heightmap) terrain generator based on it, and later a side-view based terrain generator.  My terrain generators worked well. As I common with me, I eventually moved on to other projects.</p><p>Fast forward a few months to when I became interested again in making a 2D platformer. I liked the terrain generators I had made previously, but they were kind of slow. I wondered if the seedable random number generator was the problem. It was supposedly &quot;cryptographically secure&quot;, but I didn't care about security. All I cared was it generated values that didn't look repetitive. Based on this idea, I looked for a really simple function that produced reasonably random looking results, and I eventually settled on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function">FNV Hash</a>. I quickly implemented this and packaged my noise generator in a simple Javascript library I call <a href="QuickNoise.html">QuickNoise</a>. It runs much faster than my original version, and produces great results! As a simple example, here's a bit of terrain that uses <a href="QuickNoise.html">QuickNoise</a> as a starting point:</p><p><img src="KerwizzyBlogData/QuickNoise-Demo2.jpg"><br><em>Some terrain made with <a href="QuickNoise.html">QuickNoise</a> as the noise generator</em><br></p>
